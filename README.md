# self-Propelled-Satellites
The system is formed by self-propelled satellites influenced by the Sun whose objective is not to leave the domain maintaining the maximum possible speed.

All satellites start at the same point with zero velocity, interacting with the Sun according to Newton's law of universal gravitation. Each satellite can auto propel.
